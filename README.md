# SharpTrader [ work in progress ]
SharpTrader is just an other library to create, test and run bots for trading automation.
I started the project to target crypto currencies trading but it can be expanded in future.

Features:
  * market simulation based on 1 minute data for backtesting
  * backtest multiple symbols or markets at the same time
  * bots are not restricted to use only one symbol or market
  * Higher level binance market api interface ( using modified BinanceExchange.API under the hood )
  * backtesting parameters optimization
  * more to come
TODO - Add sample bot

Many thanks to the guy that stole the api key of my working bot, that i mistakenly committed here, and stole 6 ETH from me.
